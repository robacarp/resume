  <h3>A Photographic Start</h3>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>
    A "pretty picture on my new tab" browser extension for Firefox.
  </p>
  <p>
    After WebExtension became the Firefox extension format, none of the "pretty new tab" extensions worked anymore. This is a WebExtension version of many other "pretty new tab" extensions.
  </p>
  <p>
  My personal goal is to provide a privacy focused experience. No tracking code or centralized servers counting loads, which could also be used to profile user activity or provide ads. The images are chosen in-browser from a <a href="https://robacarp.github.io/photographic_start/feed.json">static feed.json</a> hosted by Github Pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Special attention given to:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decentralized image hosting (unsplash)</li>
      <li>Safe-For-Work-Only image library -- not wildcard search based</li>
      <li>Organized display of library images to avoid repeats</li>
      <li>Cached images for fast display</li>
      <li>Chrome / Firefox support</li>
    </ul>
