  <h3>Ruby CLI: Nemucod Ransomware Recovery Tool</h3>
  <p class="indent"><strong>Written:</strong> Jan, 2017</p>
  <p class="indent"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
    A family member recently became a victim of this scam and asked me for help, but the decryptor available didn't look like it'd run on a mac or linux. I'm always interested in diving into some malware and bit math, so I built this ruby tool to derive the key and decrypt ransomed files.

  <p class="indent">
    <strong>Compiling Status:</strong> valid.

    <strong>Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/robacarp/nemucod_decrypt">Github: robacarp/nemucod_decrypt</a>
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    Since this isn't a code library, it's difficult to extract relevant code samples from the repository. One specific area of interest may be the <a href="https://github.com/robacarp/nemucod_decrypt/tree/master/uncrypt_nemucod/cli">CLI interaction classes</a> which handle interfacing with the terminal and coordinating the algorithm execution.
