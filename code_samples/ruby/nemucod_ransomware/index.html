  <h3>Ruby CLI: Nemucod Ransomware Recovery Tool</h3>
  <p class="indent"><strong>Written:</strong> Jan, 2017</p>
  <p class="indent"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
    A family member recently became a victim of this scam and asked me for help, but the decryptor available didn't look like it'd run on a mac or linux. I'm always interested in diving into some malware and bit math, so I built this ruby tool to derive the key and decrypt ransomed files.

  # Nemucod prioritizes lockdown speed over encryption viability.
  # The cipher is a fixed key length xor'd over the first key-length
  # bytes of the file. This gives the ransomware the ability to
  # rapidly encrypt thousands of files but results in weak security.

    while offset < KEY_LENGTH && offset < @crypted_file.size
      @key_file.pos = offset
      @crypted_file.pos = offset

      key_byte     = @key_file.read 1
      crypted_byte = @crypted_file.read 1
      decrypt_byte = pack( unpack(key_byte) ^ unpack(crypted_byte) )

      @decrypted_file.write decrypt_byte

      offset += 1
    end

    @crypted_file.close
    @key_file.close
