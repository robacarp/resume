  <h3>Generic Authentication Backend</h3>
  <p class="indent"><strong>Written:</strong> September, 2015</p>
  <p class="indent"><strong>Abstract:</strong>
    Large rails applications often have a diaspora of methods used to determine if a user should be allowed to
    perform some action on the system, resulting in a difficult to maintain and debug authorization system.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    These classes represent my attempt to provide a central system for authorization with the following requirements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Public access can be explictly granted or revoked.</li>
    <li>Support polymorphic relationships throughout.</li>
    <li>Easily taught to traverse relationships between models efficiently, querying at O(1) where possible.</li>
    <li>Allows for granting access via user collection mechanisms such as ownership data, or membership data.</li>
    <li>Support granting for CRUD actions as well as unique per-object actions.</li>
  </ul>
