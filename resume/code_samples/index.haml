  %h3 Code Samples
  %p.indent
    This is a list of several projects that I consider to be my best work. Some of it goes back several years,
    but it has become work which I muse about often and still have a lot of pride in. Often the algorithms are
    trivial, but the code is well organized, implements some needed feature, or carries fond memories.
  %p.indent
    Each project has a small readme with code highlights and some meta details. Where relevant, documentation
    on how to run the code are included.
